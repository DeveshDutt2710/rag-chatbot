booked.", "FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit.", "Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD?", "Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction.", "Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality.", "TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens.", "Interest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab.", "For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax.", "Our experts will be

entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c.", "In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not

to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment.", "IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system.", "However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c.", "In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?", "Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.", "So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.", "Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date.", "Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment are Non-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO?", "Tax will be levied on your

to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order.", "If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected.", "That\u2019s why we inform you while exiting if there\u2019s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections.", "My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed.", "There could be 2 major reasons behind this: The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth.", "Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold. a.", "For example: Let\u2019s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at \u20b990.", "Upon reaching \u20b990, the first 50 sellers\u2019 orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers.", "In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa.", "The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at \u20b9100 and limit price at \u20b9100.", "Now imagine that the LTP touched \u20b9100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below \u20b9100 due to high volatility.", "The limit price of \u20b9100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only \u20b9100 or more.", "Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100.", "Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility.", "Note: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price.", "This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn\u2019t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed.", "Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility.", "My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared.", "Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment.", "Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility.", "As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere.", "Price matching and execution of the orders\u00a0 is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker.", "Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade.", "Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level.", "Stop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade.", "A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade.", "If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage.", "If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order.", "Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition.", "A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached.", "Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses.", "The 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade.", "It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn\u2019t cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered.", "Can I use stop-loss in trading with the AngelOne Trading app?", "You can place a Stop loss order\u00a0 in AngelOne mobile app by following the below simple steps: Visit the AngelOne app and select the stock to Buy/Sell Select quantity of the trade Set\u2019 Trigger price\u2019 Enter the price where you want to place stop-loss Confirm the stop-loss price, click on \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d and confirm
